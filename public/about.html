    <p>
      Iâ€™m a software engineer in the San Francisco Bay Area. I work on the engineering team at Ayasdi, building front-end applications for a platform that blends traditional machine learning techniques with topological data analysis.

      More generally I enjoy geeking out about books, math and science, cooking, beer and wine, and human languages.
