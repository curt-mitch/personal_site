            I initially started work on this project to test out website and web development ideas, to have a place to tinker with various frameworks and UI libraries, and to have a place to write articles with more control over the appearance and layout. It&apos;s also a showcase of articles and projects to share with recruiters, hiring managers, and colleagues. <span role="img" aria-label="grinning face">üòÑ</span>

            The frontend portion of the site was bootstrapped using the <a className={styles.link} color="secondary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://create-react-app.dev/">Create React App</a> tool and uses <a className={styles.link} color="secondary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a className={styles.link} color="secondary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reactrouter.com/">React Router</a>, and several components from <a className={styles.link} color="secondary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://material-ui.com/">Material-UI</a>. This does mean that a user must have JavaScript enabled for their browser, and much of the site could certainly be a more lightweight, progressive web application. But building something using React was a primary goal for me and I have nonetheless added <a className={styles.link} color="secondary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#route-based-code-splitting">router-based code splitting</a> to reduce the loading time by about 30% to 50% across the site.

            The backend of the website is a <a className={styles.link} color="secondary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> application with a <a className={styles.link} color="secondary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html">SQLite</a> database. I built this backend in order to learn the Django framework itself and to have an environment for deploying my Python-based machine learning projects. Additionally, I‚Äôm using the <a className={styles.link} color="secondary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/">Django REST framework</a> for API endpoints rather than utilizing the default Django template layer (the ‚Äúview‚Äù layer in standard MVC architectures).

            The entire project is hosted on <a className={styles.link} color="secondary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> and served via <a className={styles.link} color="secondary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> containers. The site&apos;s web server is <a className={styles.link} color="secondary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nginx.com/">NGINX</a> with HTTPS enabled thanks to TLS certificates issued by <a className={styles.link} color="secondary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let&apos;s Encrypt</a>. I&apos;ve made additional NGINX customizations to enable more efficient features such as gzip text compression and HTTP/2, as well as ensure that I have an A+ SSL rating from <a className={styles.link} color="secondary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=curt-mitch.com">Qualys</a>. The site currently has a performance score of roughly 96 for desktop and 78 for mobile using Google&apos;s <a className={styles.link} color="secondary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">PageSpeed Insights</a>, and I‚Äôm hoping to increase those scores in future rounds of refactoring by using techniques and features such as images with more efficient compression.

            The fractal design on the homepage was generated using this tool: <a className={styles.link} color="secondary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://rectangleworld.com/blog/archives/462">Generative Art in HTML5 Canvas ‚Äì Sweeping Fractal Lines</a>. I also owe my friend and experienced creative director <a className={styles.link} color="secondary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.mbarnesdesigns.com/">Mathew Barnes</a> my gratitude for his wireframes and design suggestions to give this site a wonderful esthetic boost.
