            Iâ€™m a software developer based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Iâ€™ve worked at a variety of analytics- and machine learning-startups as a web developer, and now Iâ€™m enrolled in Springboardâ€™s <a href="https://www.springboard.com/workshops/ai-machine-learning-career-track/">machine learning engineering track</a> in the next stage of my career and pursuit of using technology to make complex data more comprehensible.

            Iâ€™ve worked at a variety of analytics and machine learning startups and a web developer. Most recently I was at <a href="https://mode.com/">Mode Analytics</a> where I was the lead engineer on a full stack project to capture screenshots of analytics reports and conducted a JavaScript workshop for other internal teams. Prior to that I worked at <a href="https://www.ayasdi.com/">Ayasdi</a> where I migrated key parts of our web application UI from the Backbone framework to React and Redux and helped implement a complex UX feature wherein data points selected by a user in one visualization were simultaneously highlighted in other visualizations of the same dataset.

            I moved into web development after being in one of the first cohorts of the coding bootcamp <a href="https://www.hackreactor.com/">Hack Reactor</a>, and prior to that I worked as a data analyst and field engineer for the energy consulting firm <a href="https://www.dnvgl.com/">DNV GL</a> for several years after completing undergraduate degrees in physics and math from the <a href="https://www.unt.edu/">University of North Texas</a>. As a born-and-raised Texan I like to refer to myself as a NorCal Texpat ðŸ¤

            Outside of the worlds of software and analytics my hobbies include reading all categories of books, especially fiction and history (recent favorites include <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33590210-an-american-marriage">An American Marriage</a>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223380.Stories_of_Your_Life_and_Others">Stories of Your Life and Others</a>, and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76401.Bury_My_Heart_at_Wounded_Knee">Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee</a>), cooking, meditation, martial arts and exercise, and studying foreign languages (previously: German and Spanish, recently: Urdu, continually: Japanese). I also enjoy traveling and probably my favorite travel experience was getting to live in a dojo in rural Japan for a summer while training in Aikido.
