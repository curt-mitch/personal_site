            Iâ€™m a software developer based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

            Iâ€™ve worked at a variety of analytics and machine learning startups as a web developer. Most recently I was at <Link color="secondary" underline="hover" href="https://mode.com/">Mode Analytics</Link> where I was the lead engineer on a full stack project to capture screenshots of analytics reports and conducted a JavaScript workshop for other internal teams. Prior to that I worked at <Link color="secondary" underline="hover" href="https://www.ayasdi.com/">Ayasdi</Link> where I migrated key parts of our web application UI from the Backbone framework to React and Redux and helped implement a complex UX feature wherein data points selected by a user in one visualization were simultaneously highlighted in other visualizations of the same dataset.

            I moved into web development after being in one of the first cohorts of the coding bootcamp <Link color="secondary" underline="hover" href="https://www.hackreactor.com/">Hack Reactor</Link>, and prior to that I worked as a data analyst and field engineer for the energy consulting firm <Link color="secondary" underline="hover" href="https://www.dnvgl.com/">DNV GL</Link> for several years after completing undergraduate degrees in physics and math from the <Link color="secondary" underline="hover" href="https://www.unt.edu/">University of North Texas</Link>. As a born-and-raised Texan living in the Bay Area I like to refer to myself as a NorCal Texpat. ðŸ¤

            Outside of the worlds of software and analytics my hobbies include reading all categories of books, especially fiction and history (recent favorites include <Link color="secondary" underline="hover" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33590210-an-american-marriage">An American Marriage</Link>, <Link color="secondary" underline="hover" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223380.Stories_of_Your_Life_and_Others">Stories of Your Life and Others</Link>, and <Link color="secondary" underline="hover" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/76401.Bury_My_Heart_at_Wounded_Knee">Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee</Link>), cooking, meditation, martial arts and exercise, and studying foreign languages (previously: German and Spanish, recently: Urdu, continually: Japanese). I also enjoy traveling and probably my favorite travel experience was getting to live in a dojo in rural Japan for a summer while training in Aikido.
